  The course provides a thorough introduction to operating system.
  Topics include threads and processes, process coordination and synchronization, physical and virtual storage organization, interrupt handling, peripheral devices and file systems.
  The exercises include both analysis of abstractions, and their design and implementation.
  During the course each student will develop a running operating system kernel for an Intel x86 based computer.
